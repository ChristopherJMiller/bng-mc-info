        <h3>How to get started</h3>
        <p>
          ACE Minecraft is equipped with plugins to customize the usual vanilla experience! The following is a guide for how to get starting working with these plugins and commands for those not familiar:
        </p>

        <h3>The Economy</h3>
        <p>
          Lapis (and lapis blocks) are the main form of currency! Create <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chestshop.51856/">chest shops</a> to trade with other members! 
        </p>
        <h4>Storing your Money</h4>
        <p>
          Worried about keeping all of your money in your inventory? Create a <a href="https://github.com/nikosgram/Gringotts/wiki/Usage">vault</a> for a secure location to store your money. This stored money can be deposited and withdrawn from anywhere.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
# View Personal Balance
/money
# Pay a Player (Transaction fees apply)
/money pay {amount} {player}
# Withdraw or Deposit into your vault
/money withdraw|deposit {amount}
        </code></pre>
        <h3>Build your home using a Town!</h3>
        <p>
          By default, you cannot build or break in the wilderness (with the exception of ores and plants). Claim ownership over a region of the world by forming a <a href="https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/How-Towny-Works#how-towns-grow">town!</a> Towns provide block protection against anyone not in your town and allows you to manage plots for your townmembers!
        </p>
        <h4>Quick guide to forming a town.</h4>
          <pre><code>
# Create your town (your current chunk will become the home of the town)
/town new {townname}
# Invite friends to your town!
/town add {playername}
# Claim new chunks for your town
/town claim
          </code></pre>
        <h4>Town Upkeep</h4>
        <p>
          It costs <b>8 lapis</b> per real-world day to keep your town active. You can create a <a href="https://github.com/nikosgram/Gringotts/wiki/Usage">vault</a> for your town to stock up on currency for multiple days worth of upkeep! Banking for your town can be done either in your town homeblock (your town's origin) or in a <a href="https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/How-Towny-Works#plot-types">bank plot.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking for your town members to help pay the upkeep? Mayors can set <a href="https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/How-Towny-Works#taxes-and-upkeep">taxes</a> that instantly go into the town vault. Taxes are collected at noon everyday.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
# Deposit money into your town's vault
/town deposit {$}
        </code></pre>
        <h3>Create Warps to Connect the World</h3>
        <p>
          Players can create warp locations to connect the world! All warps are public when <a href="https://github.com/MyWarp/MyWarp/wiki/Command-Reference">created</a> and must be warped to either via a command or warp sign. The <samp>/to</samp> command can only be used within spawn. However, warp signs can be created anywhere given a much higher cost!
        </p>
        <pre><code>
# Create a warp (Costs 64 Lapis)
/warp create {name}
# Warp via command from spawn (Costs 16 Lapis)
/to {warp name}
# View list of all warps (Free)
/warp list
# Use a compass to point to a warp location (Costs 4 Lapis)
/warp point {warp name}
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          See the <a href="https://github.com/MyWarp/MyWarp/wiki/Command-Reference">command reference</a> for more commands. Note that some are unaccessible due to server permissions.
