        <h3>How to get started</h3>
        <p>
          BNG Minecraft is equipped with plugins to customize the usual vanilla experience! The following is a guide for how to get starting working with these plugins and commands for those not familiar:
        </p>

        <h3>Build your home using a Town!</h3>
        <p>
          By default, you cannot build or break in the wilderness (with the exception of ores and plants). Claim ownership over a region of the world by forming a <a href="https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/How-Towny-Works#how-towns-grow">town!</a> Towns provide block protection against anyone not in your town and allows you to manage plots for your townmembers!
        </p>
        <h4>Quick guide to forming a town.</h4>
          <pre><code>
# Create your town (your current chunk will become the home of the town)
/town new {townname}
# Invite friends to your town!
/town add {playername}
# Claim new chunks for your town
/town claim
          </code></pre>
        <h3>Create Warps to Connect the World</h3>
        <p>
          Players can create warp locations to connect the world! All warps are public when <a href="https://github.com/MyWarp/MyWarp/wiki/Command-Reference">created</a> and must be warped to either via a command or warp sign. The <samp>/to</samp> command can only be used within spawn. However, warp signs can be created anywhere given a much higher cost!
        </p>
        <pre><code>
# Create a warp
/warp create {name}
# Warp via command from spawn
/to {warp name}
# View list of all warps
/warp list
# Use a compass to point to a warp location
/warp point {warp name}
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          See the <a href="https://github.com/MyWarp/MyWarp/wiki/Command-Reference">command reference</a> for more commands. Note that some are unaccessible due to server permissions.
        </p>
